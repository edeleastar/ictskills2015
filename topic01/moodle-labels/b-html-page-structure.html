    <p>We can now explore the basics of HTML and we will try to get to grips with the fundamentals of the HTML language. As you will see, its structure and format is relatively straightforward, and you will be able to understand the basics very quickly. We will be focusing on a small number of 'tags' to get started, and also on the ways in which different html files can be linked together to form a site. </p>
